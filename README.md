# OASIS
The project aims to create an Airways application that models the routes between airports as a graph, where each airport is a vertex and the routes between them are edges with weights representing the distance or time taken to travel between the airports. 
Using graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's or Bellman-Ford, the application will find the shortest path between a starting and destination airport and display the corresponding flights to the user.

Additional features can be implemented to make the application more useful for users, such as filtering flights based on user preferences, comparing prices of flights from different airlines, and allowing users to book their flights directly through the application.
